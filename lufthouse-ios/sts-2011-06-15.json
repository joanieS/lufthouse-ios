This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed\n      information about using this service, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UsingSTS/Welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\">Using\n        Temporary Security Credentials</a>. </p>\n\n    <note> As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of\n      libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET,\n      iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to\n      STS. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing\n      errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how\n      to download and install them, see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon\n        Web Services page</a>. </note>\n\n    <p>For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html\" target=\"_blank\">Signing AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.

      "documentation":"<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret\n      access key, and a security token) that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not\n      normally have access to. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account access\n      or federation. </p>\n\n    <p><b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>AssumeRole</code> by using AWS account credentials;\n      access will be denied. You must use IAM user credentials or temporary security credentials\n      to call <code>AssumeRole</code>. </p>\n\n    <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources\n      in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those\n      resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which\n      account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one\n      account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by\n      assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html\">Roles</a> in\n        <i>Using IAM</i>. </p>\n\n    <p>For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS Management\n      Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system in your corporate network,\n      you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user identities\n      access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code>\n      (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials\n      for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that\n      users can use to access the console. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/STSUseCases.html\">Scenarios for\n        Granting Temporary Access</a> in <i>Using Temporary Security Credentials</i>. </p>\n\n    <p>The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling\n        <code>AssumeRole</code>, which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1\n      hour). The default is 1 hour. </p>\n\n\n    <p>Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose not to pass\n      a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the\n      permissions that are defined in the access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you\n      pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the\n      operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is\n      being assumed, <i><b>and</b></i> the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further\n      restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the\n      passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of\n      the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/permissions-assume-role.html\">Permissions for\n        AssumeRole</a> in <i>Using Temporary Security Credentials</i>.</p>\n\n    <p>To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is\n      defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. You must also have a policy that\n      allows you to call <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>. </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b>\n    </p>\n    <p>You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call\n        <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios in which you want to\n      make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been authenticated using an AWS MFA\n      device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that\n      tests for MFA authentication; if the caller does not include valid MFA information, the\n      request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA\n      authentication might look like the following example.</p>\n\n    <p>\n      <code>\"Condition\": {\"Null\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthAge\": false}}</code>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring\n        MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>Using IAM</i> guide. </p>\n\n    <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code>\n      and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the\n      user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time\n      password (TOTP) that the MFA devices produces. </p>\n\n\n    <member name=\"RoleArn\" target=\"arnType\"></member>\n    <member name=\"RoleSessionName\" target=\"userNameType\"></member>\n    <member name=\"Policy\" target=\"sessionPolicyDocumentType\"></member>\n    <member name=\"DurationSeconds\" target=\"roleDurationSecondsType\"></member>\n    <member name=\"ExternalId\" target=\"externalIdType\"></member>\n    <examples>\n      <queryrequest>https://sts.amazonaws.com/\n?Version=2011-06-15\n&Action=AssumeRole\n&RoleSessionName=Bob\n&RoleArn=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/demo\n&Policy=%7B%22Version%22%3A%222012-10-17%22%2C%22Statement%22%3A%5B%7B%22Sid%22%3A%22Stmt1%22%2C%22Effect%22%\n 3A%22Allow%22%2C%22Action%22%3A%22s3%3A*%22%2C%22Resource%22%3A%22*%22%7D\n %5D%7D\n&DurationSeconds=3600\n&ExternalId=123ABC\n&AUTHPARAMS</queryrequest>\n\n      <queryresponse><AssumeRoleResponse xmlns=\"https://sts.amazonaws.com/doc/\n2011-06-15/\">\n  <AssumeRoleResult>\n    <Credentials>\n      <SessionToken>\n       AQoDYXdzEPT//////////wEXAMPLEtc764bNrC9SAPBSM22wDOk4x4HIZ8j4FZTwdQW\n       LWsKWHGBuFqwAeMicRXmxfpSPfIeoIYRqTflfKD8YUuwthAx7mSEI/qkPpKPi/kMcGd\n       QrmGdeehM4IC1NtBmUpp2wUE8phUZampKsburEDy0KPkyQDYwT7WZ0wq5VSXDvp75YU\n       9HFvlRd8Tx6q6fE8YQcHNVXAkiY9q6d+xo0rKwT38xVqr7ZD0u0iPPkUL64lIZbqBAz\n       +scqKmlzm8FDrypNC9Yjc8fPOLn9FX9KSYvKTr4rvx3iSIlTJabIQwj2ICCR/oLxBA==\n      </SessionToken>\n      <SecretAccessKey>\n       wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYzEXAMPLEKEY\n      </SecretAccessKey>\n      <Expiration>2011-07-15T23:28:33.359Z</Expiration>\n      <AccessKeyId>AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE</AccessKeyId>\n    </Credentials>\n    <AssumedRoleUser>\n      <Arn>arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/demo/Bob</Arn>\n      <AssumedRoleId>ARO123EXAMPLE123:Bob</AssumedRoleId>\n    </AssumedRoleUser>\n    <PackedPolicySize>6</PackedPolicySize>\n  </AssumeRoleResult>\n  <ResponseMetadata>\n    <RequestId>c6104cbe-af31-11e0-8154-cbc7ccf896c7</RequestId>\n  </ResponseMetadata>\n</AssumeRoleResponse></queryresponse>\n\n    </examples>"

Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices)\n      that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in\n      the application, and without deploying server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS\n      credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web\n      identity provider. </p>\n\n    <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a\n      secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security\n      credentials to sign calls to AWS service APIs. The credentials are valid for the duration that\n      you specified when calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, which can be from 900\n      seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). By default, the temporary security credentials\n      are valid for 1 hour. </p>\n\n    <p>Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation.

If you\n      pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the\n      operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is\n      being assumed, <i><b>and</b></i> the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further\n      restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the\n      passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of\n      the role that is being assumed.
