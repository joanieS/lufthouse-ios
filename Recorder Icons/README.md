Hi there!

If you're looking at this and you work at Apple, you're probably wondering why you hit a tour image screen and then it stops.

Well, turns out you need some iBeacons for this app!

If you'd like to have a glimpse at some of the functionality of this app, you'll need to broadcast with the following settings:

UUID: B9407F30-F5F8-466E-AFF9-25556B57FE6D
Minor IDs:
19206
42298

Thanks for your consideration!
